Profile summary

I have been in the IT industry for more than a decade and I had spent time in various roles. I started in a support role back in 2008 and progressively moved on to more technically advanced roles and subsequently landing into more managerial position.
During the years, I have acquired “industry standard” skills as I was exposed to various products from the industry household names and infrastructure environments. VM Ware, Veeam, Microsoft & Linux, Cisco, Aruba Ubiquity, Ruckus, Oracle and other software or hardware products to name a few.
However, as technology and approach to the IT is evolving so is my current interest. I have been lately focused on cloud technologies and modern DevOps and SysOps approach to the IT discipline especially from the AWS offerings. I am aware that the current trend in IT operations is moving fast into automation and knowing how to handle a code is a necessity. Serverless, containers, cloud, CI/CD and git are not foreign buzzwords for me.
Nevertheless, during the last 5 years I was fortunate to had worked and lived in interesting places and experience firsthand what others might read in adventure books. On the less bright side, I do not have much real-life exposure into the DevOps and SysOps world as I was in environments that embraced the older way of “doing” IT. To keep my career in progress and ensure that I have some minimal knowledge, I have recently passed, number of cloud certifications and working on few more to solidify my skill set.
Lately I have returned to the EU and I am looking for an opportunity to work on an interesting project either in a full-time position or in a freelance role. The ideal that I am most interested is a company that have already embraced or is in the process of moving into automation, DevOps and SysOps operations and creates an interesting product.
